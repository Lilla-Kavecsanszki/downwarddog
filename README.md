# DownwardDog Yoga Studio

This website is designed to bring together all yoga fans who are also dog owners, creating a safe place for them to practise yoga together and the opportunity for a vibrant community. 
The main focus is to be straight forward enough to save time for the user, yet to be engaging and motivating at the same time.

The user can interact with the website in various ways such as viewing relevant and uselful information on the articles page. The users, if they are registered and logged in, then can comment on the articles and also can express their opinion with a like. They can later also unlike the article, in case they changed their mind. 
The users can also see a selection of yoga classes, then also a selection of available dates and times for the relevant classes to choose from through the Yoga page. If they are logged in, they will be able to book, register their interest. After admin approval, the user is able to follow up their bookings on the My Bookings page, and also to edit or delete the bookings that they wish to.  

This full-stack framework project was built using Django framework, Python, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. Furthermore, ElephantSQL and Cloudinary was also used to store data, images and CSS.

# Planning

The planning process started with determining the target clientele, by creating a Persona Profile - by using Code Institutes template - based on design thinking. Therefore the website aims to cater to the needs, expectations and preferences of the identified persona.
You can see the persona profile [HERE](README_docs/design_thinking_persona_template.pdf).

Given the prevalence of mobile usage among our target users, creating a responsive website was a top priority in our design approach. To achieve this, we leveraged the power of Bootstrap grids, elements, and responsive utilities combined with custom CSS, to ensure seamless adaptability across various devices.

### Agile Methodology

In this project Github issues were used to create the User stories and groupped into Epics, in a Github Project. This served as the Agile tool. The issues' development was managed through a Kanban board. Currently, all the issues have been marked as "Done‚Äù.

For easy access, you can find the Epics, User Stories/ Issues, and Kanban board [HERE](https://github.com/users/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/projects/5).

# Design

### Wireframes

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

To support the functionality of the DownwardDog app, five models have been designed and implemented to store essential information in databases. 

To showcase the relationships between the models, I have divided them into two categories: one relevant to the Articles and the other to the Booking functionality.

The Entity Relationship Diagrams below illustrate how the models are connected to each other for the Articles section:
- Post and Comment have a one-to-many relationship, where one post can have multiple comments, but each comment is associated with only one post.
- User and Likes have a many-to-many relationship, where multiple users can like multiple posts, and each like is linked to both a user and a post.
(- User and Post have a one-to-many relationship, where one user can be associated with multiple posts, but each post is linked to only one user (the author). This feature is however limited for the admin therefore not displayed)

<p>
<details><summary>Article ERD</summary><br/>
<img src="README_docs/images/article_erd.png" alt="Article ERD">
</details>

The Entity Relationship Diagrams below illustrate how the models are connected to each other for the Booking section:
- Classes and Timetable have a one-to-many relationship, where one class can have multiple timetables, but each timetable is associated with only one class.
- Timetable and Booking have a one-to-many relationship, where one timetable can have multiple bookings, but each booking is linked to only one timetable.
- Booking and User have a many-to-one relationship, where one user can create many bookings. 

The unique_booking constraint in the Booking model ensures that a user can create multiple bookings, but only one booking for a specific class on a specific date/time.

### Colour Scheme

- White
- Whitesmoke #f5f5f5
- Very dark (mostly black) cyan #141c1e
- Dark moderate lime green #48a04f
- Bright red #ed3833

![colour_palette](README_docs/images/colorkit.png "colour_palette")
[My Colour Palette](https://colorkit.co/palette/f5f5f5-f8d649-48a04f-44aedd-8f4ec4-ed3833-141c1e/)

I picked these specific colours based on the purpose of the website and what the studio wishes to achieve. I made that decision for a playful and fun aesthetics that can also give a calming effect to the visitors at the same time. 

### Typography

The primary font used for the website is Poiret One. It was chosen because I found this font to be

![Poiret One](README_docs/images/poiret_one.png "poiret_one")

The secondary font used for the body is Montserrat, which was selected for its clear readability, which works well with Poiret One to maintain the airy yet fun outcome.

# Features

## Home Page

### F01 Navigation Bar

The navigation bar provides easy access to all active pages for the user.

**Menu Options:**

- **Logo:** Essentially it indicates the name of the website, while it also serves as a button that is linked to the homepage as an instant solution for the user. The logo also includes a "jumping" paw icon in the website's signature orange colour, adding an eye-catching and playful effect that draws the user's attention to the business name
- **Home:** This button serves as a quick link to the homepage, enabling users to navigate back to the main landing page at any point.
- **Articles:** Users can explore and read articles by clicking on this button, which further leads them to a detailed page showcasing various content if they want to. The logged-in user will also be able to comment the articles or like them. The non-logged-in user can only view.
- **Yoga:** The "Yoga" button takes users to a list of available classes. Each class is presented with relevant information and a button, 'Availabilities', which through the Users can choose their preferred date and time, and go ahead to book their desired class. At the end, only logged-in user can proceed with a booking, non-logged in users will be redirected to the Login page.

##### Logged-In Users

For logged-in users, the navigation bar includes two additional menu options:

- **My Bookings:** This button provides quick access to view and manage the user's booked classes.
- **Logout:** Users can log out by clicking on this option.
  
![Navbar Logged_In](README_docs/images/navbar_loggedin.png "navbar_logged_in")

For non-logged-in users, the following options are available instead:

- **Register:** Users can register and create an account to gain access to more features and personalized content.
- **Login:** Clicking on this button allows users to log in with their credentials and access personalized content and more features.
  
![Navbar Not Logged_In](README_docs/images/navbar_nonloggedin.png "navbar_not_logged_in")

##### Special Case for Administrators

When the signed-in user is the admin user or superuser, an additional link labeled "Admin" is displayed on the navigation bar.

- **Admin:** This link grants access to the Django Admin window, allowing the superuser to manage the website's data, such as adding new, modifying, deleting or using them.
  
![Navbar Admin](README_docs/images/navbar_admin.png "navbar_admin")

##### Decorative Element

On the right-hand side of the navigation bar, a muted text adds a touch of decoration. If a user is logged in, their username, along side by a user icon, is displayed. Otherwise, the text "Breathe.. or bark?" is shown, adding a playful and welcoming touch to the user interface.

The navigation bar is fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes, and it collapses on mobile screens, displaying a hamburger icon for easy navigation.

![Navbar Hamburger](README_docs/images/navbar_hamburger.png "navbar_hamburger")

![Navbar Hamburger Open](README_docs/images/navbar_hamburger_open.png "navbar_hamburger_open")

### F02 Hero Image and Overlay Text

Underneath the navbar, the Home page features a very relevant photo of a woman doing yoga with a dog next to her. There is also a text overlay on top of the image, displaying the name of the website and the business, and also gives a clear idea of its purpose too.

![Hero Image and Text](README_docs/images/hero_feature.png "hero_image&text")

### F03 Encouragement Text and Get started button

Underneath the hero image, there is a larger text displayed, that encouraging the user to discover the available classes and with the button below it, instantly leads to the goal of the website, which is to get the user to book a class/ classes. The button therefore directs the user to the Yoga page, that lists the classes that can be booked.

![Encouragement Text and Button](README_docs/images/goal.png "encouragement_text&button")

### F04 Story and Team

Below F03 the user can see a section that includes 2 parts, where the website offers an introduction to the business namely its Story and its Team. On the opposite side of the texts, a stylized image of a stretching pug is displayed as a decorative element, visually capturing the essence and ambiance of the business.

![Introduction](README_docs/images/introduction.png "Introduction")

### F05 Contact section

F05 includes a section through that the user can find the business and/or reach out. The title on top makes this purpose very clear, then underneath of that the address is shown. On the opposite side, a contact form is provided. The user is required to fill in their name, email, and message before they can submit the form using the 'Send Message' button. The button is disabled until all required fields are correctly filled out. Additionally, the email field validates the input to ensure it includes an '@' sign before submission. 

![Contact](README_docs/images/contact.png "contact")

When the contact form is filled out as required and submitted, the user will see a reassuring message popping up in green, letting them know that their message was successfully sent, then will also disappear in 2 seconds.
In case of an error, and so failure of sending the message, a red message pops up informing the user that the submition failed and prompts them to try again.

![Email Message](README_docs/images/email_message.png "email_message")

### F06 Footer 

Just as the navigation bar, the footer is also presented on each page. It is at the very bottom, displaying information about the website creator, along with convenient links to the developer's Github and LinnkedIn profils. It also shows a disclaimer, clarifying that the website was created for educational use only. 

![Footer](README_docs/images/footer.png "footer")

## Articles page

### F07 List of the articles

On this page, users can browse through four articles per page, each displaying their titles, relevant images, author names, publication dates, and the number of likes they have received. 
Pagination allows users to navigate to the next set of four articles using the "Next" button located below the last article. 

![Pagination Button](README_docs/images/pagination_button.png "pagination_button")

![Articles List](README_docs/images/articles_list.png "articles_list")

### F08 Articles Detail page

By clicking on the article titles, users are brought onto the Articles Detail page to read the full content and view likes, and any associated and approved comments.

![Article](README_docs/images/article.png "article")

![Like & Comment](README_docs/images/like&comment.png "like&comment")

Logged-in users have additional privileges, as they can like and comment on the articles as well. This enhanced functionality enriches the overall user experience and encourages engagement with the content and other users in the community. 
Likes are explained in F09, and Comments in F10 in more detail.

### F09 Like an article

In order for a user to like an article, they must first log in to their account. Once logged in, they can proceed to view the article's full content on the Articles Detail page and there simply click on the heart icon displayed beneath the article's content.
If the user changes their mind, they can click on the heart icon again to unlike the article. 
When the article is liked by the current user, the heart icon appears filled with the website's distinctive orange color. Additionally, a like counter is displayed next to the heart icon, indicating the number of likes the article has received from all the users.

![Likes](README_docs/images/likes.png "likes")

### F10 Comment on an article

In order for a user to comment on an article, they again must first log in to their account. Once logged in, they can proceed to view the article's full content on the Articles Detail page and there scroll to the bottom. There, next to the existing Comments section, there is a form to leave their own comment. A clear message prompts the user to leave a comment and where it should be filled in. The username also appears above the form, showing who the comment will come from. The user needs to type in their comment into the text box then press the submit button. All comments then must be approved by the administrator before they will be visible on the Articles Detail page. Once approved, the comments will appear in the comments section at the bottom of the Articles Detail page, starting with the latest one.

For the admin to approve a comment, they need to log in to the admin pages. There they need to click onto the Comments table, tick and select the comment or comments that they wish to authorise, choose the 'Approve Comments' button from the drop-down menu and finally click on 'Go'.
The second way to achieve the same is to click on the individual comment (on the name row) and there select 'Approved' box then finally press save.

There is also a comment counter, next to the like counter, that tracks the number of comments were approved for the specific article.

![Comment](README_docs/images/comment.png "comment")

![Comment Approve](README_docs/images/comment_approve.png "comment_approve")

![Individual Approve](README_docs/images/individual_approve.png "individual_approve")

## Yoga page

### F11 Video background and Overlay Text

The top of the Yoga page features a muted video of a girl doing yoga with a dog next to her. The video serves as a motivation for users to start moving as soon as they see it. To blend the video into its environment, there is a faded black overlay on top of it. Additionally, there is a text overlay suggesting the purpose of the page, and a "jumping" arrow urges the user to scroll down to explore the different yoga classes available to choose from.

![Video & Overlay](README_docs/images/video%overlay.png "video&overlay")

### F12 Yoga Class Cards

Underneath the video, users can view the different yoga classes and relevant information about them, presented on orange cards. Each class has an 'Availabilities' button that takes the user to the Yoga Detail page of the chosen class. The Yoga Detail page is also detailed under F13.

![Yoga Classes](README_docs/images/yoga_classes.png "yoga_classes")

### F13 Yoga Detail Cards

The Yoga Detail cards are displayed on the Yoga Detail page, which looks exactly the same as the Yoga page. The difference is the content of the orange cards, that this time are the yoga detail cards.
The cards show the available dates and times of the chosen class. Underneath that information on each card there is a dropdown menu, where the user can select how many dog or dogs they wish to bring to the chosen class. The default is set to 1. After the user choses this detail and if they are logged in, they can proceed and book through the cards' own 'Book Now' button. If the user is not logged in, then the button will redirect them to the Sign in page. The Book Now button is explained further in details in F15.

![Yoga Detail](README_docs/images/yoga_detail.png "yoga_detail")

### F14 Warning Text

Above the yoga detail cards on the yoga detail page, a polite warning message is displayed, explaining that users need to be logged in to book a class.

![Warning Text](README_docs/images/warning.png "warning")

### F15 Book Now

As mentioned in F13, the "Book Now" button redirects users to the Sign-in page if they are not logged in. However, for logged-in users, it handles the creation of a booking.

![Book](README_docs/images/book.png "book")

When the logged-in user press the "Book Now" button, it takes them to the My Bookings page, displaying the relevant titles and paragraphs from that, which is in this case a pending status.

![Pending Booking](README_docs/images/pending.png "pending")

If a logged-in user attempts to press the "Book Now" button twice for the same class, date and time, the constraints in the Booking model prevent that. The user will be redirected to the "My Bookings" page, where they will see a message explaining that they have already attempted to book this class and should wait for approval.

![Already Booked](README_docs/images/already_booked.png "already_booked")

For the admin to approve a booking, they need to log in to the admin pages. There they need to click onto the Bookings table, tick and select the booking or bookings that they wish to authorise, choose the 'Approve bookings' button from the drop-down menu and finally click on 'Go'.
The second way to achieve the same is to click on the individual booking (on the user row) and there select 'Approved' box then finally press save.

![Approve Booking](README_docs/images/approve_booking.png "approve_booking")

![Approve Booking Approve](README_docs/images/individual_booking_approve.png "individual_approve_booking")

## F16 My Bookings page

Logged-in users enjoy an additional option on their navbar: the "My Bookings" page. This page conveniently lists all approved bookings for the user, including the class title, username, date and time, and the number of dogs that it was booked with.
Underneath there is also a friendly and welcoming message says: See you soon! 
Under each booking in the list, users will find two buttons and a dropdown menu. The "Delete" button, detailed later in F17, allows users to cancel their bookings. On the other hand, the "Update" button, along with the dropdown menu (F18), serves to modify booking details as needed.
Additionally, a disclaimer appears at the bottom of the page, informing users that all bookings are subject to admin approval.

![Approved Booking](README_docs/images/approved_bookings.png "approved_booking")

In case the user has no (approved) bookings yet, the "My Bookings" page will display a special message indicating that the user currently has no bookings. This message serves as a notification that the user has not yet made any bookings, encouraging them to explore available classes and make their first booking.

![No Booking](README_docs/images/no_booking_yet.png "no_booking")

### F17 Delete button

When the user clicks on the "Delete" button, a confirmation dialog box pops up, prompting the user to confirm whether they really want to cancel their booking. If the user decides not to proceed with the cancellation, they can click on "Cancel," and the booking will remain intact, and they will stay on the same page with all their bookings visible. However, if they click on "OK," the booking will be deleted. The page will then refresh automatically, and the deleted booking will no longer appear in the list of approved bookings, giving the user a clear indication that the cancellation was successful.

![Delete Button](README_docs/images/delete_button.png "delete_button")

### F18 Update button and Dropdown

On the opposite side of the "Delete" button, the user has the option to update the number of dogs they wish to bring with them to the booked class. They can do this by selecting the desired number from a dropdown menu. The dropdown menu allows the user to choose any number between 1 and 5, with 5 being the maximum number of dogs they can bring. 

![Dropdown](README_docs/images/dropdown.png "dropdown")

After selecting the new number of dogs from the dropdown menu, the user can proceed by clicking the "Update" button. Upon clicking the button, the page will automatically refresh. The booking will then reappear in the list of approved bookings, displaying the updated number of dogs, providing the user with a clear indication that the update was successful. This process also ensures that the user's changes are reflected accurately in the booking details, allowing them to see the latest information without any confusion or delay.

![Update Button](README_docs/images/update_button.png "update_button")

## F19 User Authentication

The website also offers a range of personalized experiences for its users while ensures secure access to them with authentication.

To add a new article, the admin can use the "+ Add Post" button at the top right corner of the Posts table after opening that and then fill in the required data fields for the article. Each post must have a unique title, and a slug will be automatically generated based on the title as it is typed in. If the admin does not upload a specific image for the article, a default image will be used.
Articles can be saved as a "Draft" also, which is the default status. This means those articles are not visible on the Articles page until their status is chnaged to be "Published." This feature helps the admin to save their work before it is completely finished or agreed to by the management team for example and so can complete it at a later time to make it visible to the viewers.

To add a new class, the admin can use the "+ Add Classes" button at the top right corner of the Classes table after opening that and then fill in the required data fields for the yoga class. Each post must have a unique title/name, and a slug will be automatically generated based on the title as it is typed in, as well as a descriptive text and duration time, indication how long the class will last.

## Bugs

An issue came up while testing the application in the meantime;

- The 'Delete Product' function got into some issues when attempting to delete an existing product due to case sensitivity. Specifically, the function was unable to locate a product if it was inputted in lowercase or capitalized incorrectly. To address this issue, I utilized the capitalize() method in both the get_new_product() and get_deleted_product() functions. This modification ensures that the user inputs are formatted to start with a capital letter, regardless of their original input. As a result, the application can accurately locate and delete the requested products.

## Acknowledgments and Code

I received inspiration for this project from my personal experience working in the hospitality industry, as well as from my partner's struggles with similar issues at his job. These experiences helped me figure the logic for this project greatly. In addition, I reviewed the work of other students to gain a better understanding of project scope and to identify best practices for Milestone Project 3.

The below websites have been used to understand the logic of building this project with Python.

I also would like to express my gratitude to Elaine Roche, my mentor, and the tutoring team for their continuous support and valuable feedback. Their guidance, tips, and resources have been instrumental in my coding and testing skills.
